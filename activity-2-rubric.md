# Project Activity 2 - Social Coding
### Coding Option: 1 - Feature encancements of Lab 4.9.2 Code

#### What were the reasons your team selected this option? 
Minimising risk of complications later on.
Some of the team members have previously had issues with VM integration necessary for option 3; and both TAFE network and some of our personal networks lack IPv6 connectivity necessary to efficiently develop and test web-facing IPv6 programs in option 2.
