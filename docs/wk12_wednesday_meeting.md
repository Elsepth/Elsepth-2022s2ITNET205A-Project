# Week 12 Wednesday Meeting
Online meeting, Zoom call
Team Members Present: Lily, Cate, Ahmad
Dean was absent due to work commitments and was read in by email and discord.

### Agenda
Discuss final progress.
Finalise organisation of the presentation.

### Updates
Dean has done two API modules (weather and news), I will be pulling them into the main github
Ahmad has a running but feature-incomplete demo of the web API, and will be pushing to the github

### Presentation
The presentation will be conducted in class Saturday 29th using Lily's laptop.
The structure of the presentation is roughly as follows:
10 minute - general overview (Cate, with 2-3 PyQt slides by Lily)
3 minute - Demonstration of pyqt GUI program (Lily) 
2 minute - Demonstration of web GUI demo (Ahmad)
5 minute - API retrospective (Dean)
5 minute - collaboration, peer programming, and presentation retrospective (Cate)
5 minute - scrum retrospective, web retrospective (Ahmad) 
5 minute - GUI retrospective, Scrum retrospective (Lily)
Q+A opportunity 
Total estimated time: 35 minutes

The target time is just over 30 minutes. Going overtime by a moderate margin is acceptable. Lily's retrospective is at the end as an adjustable-duration buffer against the presentation being unexpectedly long or short.

Please time your speech section before Saturday. Going under time by any margin is acceptable - I can talk about scrum retrospective forever probably. If you are significantly (say, more than 50%) over time, please trim it a little.
