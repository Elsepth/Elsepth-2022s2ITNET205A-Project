### Recorder Team Role
Recorder role assigned to Cate by acclamation.

### Week 5 Review
- A webex teams was set up, but a meeting was not set up as it was thought that team members had not joined the webex team yet. The software did not adequately alert to a user going online. In the future, any online meeting times will have a voice meeting set.

- Dean is unable to attend a Tuesday morning meeting due to work scheduling. There will be an attempt to find a better midweek meeting time.

Half this project is coding, but we also want to do documentation and other agile project management related things, these are just as important as the coding. Documentation, code review, preparing the presentation, these are all important tasks as well. - Lily
