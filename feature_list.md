improved CLI UI/UX
- ! can it be compatible with both linux (bash) and windows (powershell) terminals?
	- basic CLI UI should be platform independent
	- if not, do it for bash terminal only
		- put in OS recognition and split the UI
- colors, tables?
- PyInquirer?
	- I think this is cross-platform too

graphical GUI UI/UX - 
- PyQt ?
- tkinter?
- PySimpleGUI ? (includes Qt, Tkinter, WxPython, and Remi)

- more data from the API return

- more APIs
	- mapquest static map api


- metric/imperial/nautical toggle

- transport mode (walking/car/train/ferry etc) toggles
	- check what options are on mapquest
	- handle impossible journeys

- web interface

- implement unit testing

- implement hypersonic suborbital trip calculation
- implement teleportation "calculation" (potential energy)
